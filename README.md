Python / Image generation / Gif generation

Right now I don't really know where this is going. I'm adding features that already exists somewhere for the sole purpose of doing it myself.
If at some point I'm happy with the results or some features, I may consider implementation in more performant languages. 

Actual features:
  1. Heatmaps (f: R^2 -> R)
  2. Text in images
